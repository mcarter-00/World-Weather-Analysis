    "## Here’s an outline of your project plan:\n",
    "**Task**: Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**: PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients’ weather preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**: Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world’s unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your analysis of the data will be split into three main parts, or stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Collect the Data\n",
    "* Use the NumPy module to generate more than 1,500 random latitudes and longitudes.\n",
    "* Use the citipy module to list the nearest city to the latitudes and longitudes.\n",
    "* Use the OpenWeatherMap API to request the current weather data from each unique city in your list.\n",
    "* Parse the JSON data from the API request.\n",
    "* Collect the following data from the JSON file and add it to a DataFrame:\n",
    "    * City, country, and date\n",
    "    * Latitude and longitude\n",
    "    * Maximum temperature\n",
    "    * Humidity\n",
    "    * Cloudiness\n",
    "    * Wind speed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Exploratory Analysis with Visualization \n",
    "* Create scatter plots of the weather data for the following comparisons:\n",
    "    * Latitude versus temperature\n",
    "    * Latitude versus humidity\n",
    "    * Latitude versus cloudiness\n",
    "    * Latitude versus wind speed\n",
    "* Determine the correlations for the following weather data:\n",
    "    * Latitude and temperature\n",
    "    * Latitude and humidity\n",
    "    * Latitude and cloudiness\n",
    "    * Latitude and wind speed\n",
    "* Create a series of heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API that showcases the following:\n",
    "    * Latitude and temperature\n",
    "    * Latitude and humidity\n",
    "    * Latitude and cloudiness\n",
    "    * Latitude and wind speed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Visualize Travel Data\n",
    "* Create a heatmap with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities based on a customer’s travel preferences. Complete these steps:\n",
    "    1. Filter the Pandas DataFrame based on user inputs for a minimum and maximum temperature.\n",
    "    2. Create a heatmap for the new DataFrame.\n",
    "    3. Find a hotel from the cities’ coordinates using Google’s Maps and Places API, and Search Nearby feature.\n",
    "    4. Store the name of the first hotel in the DataFrame.\n",
    "    5. Add pop-up markers to the heatmap that display information about the city, current maximum temperature, and a hotel in the city."
